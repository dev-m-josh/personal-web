              <p>
                Websites are files stored on servers, which are computers that
                host (fancy term for “store files for”) websites. These servers
                are connected to a giant network called the Internet. Now, how
                do we access these websites? This is where browsers come into
                play. Browsers are computer programs that load websites via your
                Internet connection, such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer,
                while the computers used to access these websites are known as
                "clients."

              <p style="color: grey;">
                Coding refers to writing code for servers and applications using
                programming languages. They’re called “languages” because they
                include vocabulary and grammatical rules for communicating with
                computers. They also include special commands, abbreviations,
                and punctuation that can only be read by devices and programs.
                All software is written in at least one coding language, but
                languages vary based on platform, operating system, and style.
                All languages fall into one of two categories: front-end and
                back-end. <br />
                <em>Pro Tip:</em>
                Sometimes, you'll see that businesses are seeking a full-stack
                developer. This means that you have expertise in both the front
                and back-end.

              <h2>3. What does front-end mean?</h2>
              <p>
                Front-end (or client-side) is the side of a website or software
                that you see and interact with as an Internet user. When website
                information is transferred from a server to a browser, front-end
                coding languages allow the website to function without having to
                continually “communicate” with the Internet. Front-end code
                allows users to interact with a website and play videos, expand
                or minimize images, highlight text, and more. Web developers who
                work on front-end coding work on client-side development.

              <p>
                On the contrary, the back-end (or server-side) is the side that
                you don’t see when you use the Internet. It’s the digital
                infrastructure, and to non-developers, it looks like a bunch of
                numbers, letters, and symbols. There are more back-end coding
                languages than front-end languages. That’s because browsers — at
                the front-end — only understand <em>HTML, CSS,</em> and
                <em>JavaScript,</em> but a server — at the back-end — can be
                configured to understand pretty much any language.
